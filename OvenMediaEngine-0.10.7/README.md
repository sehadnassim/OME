## What is OvenMediaEngine?

OvenMediaEngine \(OME\) is an open source, streaming server with sub-second latency. OME receives video via RTMP or other protocols from live encoders such as OBS, XSplit and transmits it on WebRTC and Low-Latency DASH. So, sub-second latency streaming from OME can work seamlessly in your browser without plug-ins. Also, OME provides [OvenPlayer](https://github.com/AirenSoft/OvenPlayer), the HTML5 standard web player.

Our goal is to make it easier for you to build a stable broadcasting/streaming service with sub-second latency.
